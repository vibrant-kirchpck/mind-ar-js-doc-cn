MindAR is an opensource web augmented reality library. It supports Image Tracking and Face Tracking.

MindAR started with AFRAME integration, so majority of these documentations are written for AFRAME integration.
Starting from version 1.1.0. MindAR support direct integration with three.js. At the moment, we only have two examples for three.js under `More Examples`. We will try to add more examples.
